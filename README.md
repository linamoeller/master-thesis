# Master Thesis Lina Möller

This repository contains the complete code and computational workflow for the Master's thesis 
"A Spatially-Functional Weighted Diversity Index for the IDENT-Experiment: Parameterization via Maximum Likelihood".

The project develops and tests a novel diversity metric — a spatially weighted extension of the Shannon index that integrates both taxonomic and functional components. The index accounts for spatial heterogeneity by  introducing distance-based weighting parameters (incline and maxdist) and allows joint modeling of biodiversity, productivity, and infestation patterns at the tree-individual level.

All analyses are based on experimental forest plot data and aim to quantify how local tree diversity influences productivity and susceptibility to bark beetle infestation. The approach combines ecological theory with statistical modeling and computational optimization.

The underlying forest plot data are **not publicly available** due to privacy, ownership, and research-agreement restrictions.  
For this reason, no raw data are included in this repository.
